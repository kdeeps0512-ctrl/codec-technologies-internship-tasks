# Task 1: Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict machine failures in advance using sensor data, helping to reduce unplanned downtime and maintenance costs.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains sensor readings such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear collected from manufacturing equipment.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training using machine learning algorithms
- Performance evaluation

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results
The trained models successfully predict machine failure with good accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of predictive maintenance techniques in manufacturing systems.
